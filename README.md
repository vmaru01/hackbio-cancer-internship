When treating a disease, microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses are often exposed to antimicrobials, drugs used to fight or control infections caused by these organisms. Over continuous exposure, however, organisms can adapt and become more tolerant to treatments via mechanisms that counteract the drug effects. As a result, drugs can become less effective and, sometimes, completely lose their potency against such organisms. The occurrence of these mechanisms that enable the continued survival of an organism after treatment is termed drug resistance.

The prevalence of drug resistance in cancer treatment highlights the need for advancements in antimicrobial resistance research. Many cancer patients around the world experience treatment failure due to drug resistance, therefore developing new methods to combat the disease remains a significant area of research as well as in reducing the rate of cancer-related mortality worldwide. While addressing this will prove challenging due to factors such as high tumour heterogeneity and complex interactions between cancer cells and the immune system, therapies that combine various treatment strategies can prove to be more effective at reducing the occurrence of resistance development.

Drug resistance arises due to various factors and occurs in many forms. In cancer biology, pre-existing conditions such as genetic mutations and anti-toxin defence pathways could play a role in the resistance of cancer cells to pharmaceutical treatments. Commonly, resistance to anti-cancer drugs is also often acquired. When cancer cells acquire drug resistance, they are often characterized by a gradual loss of efficacy to a particular treatment. Changes in the tumour microenvironment post-treatment and altered expression levels of drug-protein targets or receptors are a couple of mechanisms by which cancer cells can acquire resistance to treatment.

Sustained cell signalling and proliferation is a hallmark of cancer cells. A consequence of this is observed in many cancer subtypes where growth factor receptors are overexpressed. For example, in triple-negative breast cancer, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors (EGFR) are characterized by a high expression profile via several signalling pathways. While treatments against these cancers typically involve counteracting the protein expression using small molecule inhibitors - such as the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, resistance to this treatment strategy is common and usually results in the activation of alternate pathways that support the proliferation of the cancer cell population.

Drug resistance continues to challenge research efforts in finding a cure for cancer, therefore understanding drug resistance as well as identifying the mechanisms by which it occurs is crucial for developing more effective cancer treatments.
